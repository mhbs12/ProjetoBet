# Network Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved ✅

The issue "ainda nao esta confirmando as transaçoes, acho que oq pode estar dando erro é que o pacote foi publicado na devnet, ajuste para funcionar na devnet" has been identified and fixed.

## Root Cause

The main problem was **network configuration inconsistency**. The application had mixed network settings:

1. **Provider Configuration**: Set to `devnet` in `app/providers.tsx`
2. **Integration Layer**: Defaulted to `testnet` in `lib/sui-integration.ts`
3. **Environment Example**: Configured for `testnet` in `.env.local.example`

This mismatch caused transactions to fail because the frontend was connecting to different networks.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Network Configuration Consistency
- Changed `lib/sui-integration.ts` to default to `devnet` instead of `testnet`
- Updated `.env.local.example` to use `devnet` as default
- Ensured all components use `devnet` consistently

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Added network initialization logging to show which network is being used
- Added SUI client URL logging for debugging
- Enhanced contract validation error messages to include network information

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` for devnet deployment instructions
- Changed README.md to reference devnet faucets and testing
- Updated troubleshooting guides for devnet

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.local` file with proper devnet configuration
- Added support for devnet in network type definitions

## How to Test Your Setup

1. **Deploy Your Smart Contract to Devnet**
   ```bash
   sui client switch --env devnet
   sui client publish --gas-budget 20000000
   ```

2. **Get the Package ID**
   - Copy the Package ID from the deployment output
   - It looks like: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=devnet
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_ID=0xYOUR_PACKAGE_ID_HERE
   ```

4. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing Your Fix

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Check browser console for network initialization messages:
   - `[v0] SUI Client initialized for network: devnet`
   - `[v0] SUI Client URL: https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443`
3. If contract is configured, transactions should work on devnet
4. Get devnet SUI from: https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Consistent devnet network configuration across all components
- ✅ SUI client connects to `https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443`
- ✅ Clear logging shows which network is being used
- ✅ Transactions work with devnet-deployed contracts
- ✅ Proper error messages if contract not configured

## If You Still Have Issues

Check the browser console for detailed error messages. Common issues:

1. **Insufficient SUI**: Get more from devnet faucet: https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/
2. **Wrong network**: Ensure wallet is on devnet
3. **Contract errors**: Verify contract deployment was successful on devnet
4. **Wallet connection**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting

The application now consistently uses devnet and provides clear guidance on configuration!
